# Beautiful LLAMA - Concise Functional PyTorch Implementation

This repository presents a unique and concise functional implementation of LLaMA-3 inference using PyTorch, departing from conventional class-based structures typically associated with neural network frameworks. The implementation emphasizes simplicity, readability, and exploration of alternative coding paradigms.

## Motivation

Traditional PyTorch implementations of neural network models, especially transformer architectures like LLaMA, generally rely on class-based approaches leveraging inheritance from `nn.Module`. While effective, these methods often introduce boilerplate code, potentially obscuring the underlying algorithmic simplicity of the model.

The core motivation for this project is twofold:

1. **Exploration of Functional Programming Style**: By leveraging functions rather than classes, this code explicitly emphasizes the flow of data and transformations, offering clearer insight into each computational step.

2. **Code Conciseness and Clarity**: Reducing boilerplate and relying on direct tensor manipulations makes the logic straightforward, aiding easier understanding and educational use.

This project thus serves as a technical exploration and educational reference, demonstrating how deep learning models can be elegantly expressed using a purely functional coding style.

## Key Features

- **Purely Functional Approach**: No reliance on classes (`nn.Module`); every layer and component is implemented as a standalone function.
- **Explicit Tensor Manipulation**: Direct tensor operations clearly illustrate model computations.
- **ROPE Implementation**: Utilizes Rotary Position Embeddings efficiently through complex number tensor manipulations.
- **RMSNorm & Swish Activation**: Clearly defined normalization and activation functions that illustrate low-level operations.
- **Minimalistic Dependency Management**: Uses only core PyTorch functionalities without external libraries.

## Implementation Overview

The provided code succinctly defines:

- **Embedding Layer**: Direct tensor indexing for embeddings.
- **Transformer Blocks**: Clearly separated attention and feed-forward sub-functions.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Functional attention with manual ROPE embedding and causal masking.
- **Feed-Forward Layers**: Simple functional composition utilizing Swish activation.

## Usage

To use this implementation interactively with a chat-format terminal interface:

1. Ensure the model checkpoint (`consolidated.00.pth`) and tokenizer (`tokenizer.model`) are correctly placed.

2. Execute the interactive script:

```bash
python chat_app.py
```

3. Provide an initial system prompt and start interacting with Beautiful LLAMA directly through the terminal.

## Intended Audience

- **Researchers and Students** exploring functional programming paradigms in deep learning.
- **Educators and Practitioners** looking for concise and transparent implementations of transformer architectures.

## Future Work

Potential extensions include performance benchmarking against class-based implementations, additional optimization techniques, and exploration of further purely functional implementations for other architectures.
